# Social-App-using-Django
This social network has three different pages that users might want to visit at different times:

1. The empty URL path (/) points to the dashboard page.
2. The /profile_list URL path points to the list of profiles.
3. The /profile/<int> URL path points to a specific userâ€™s profile page.
